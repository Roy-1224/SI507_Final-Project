# SI507_Final-Project
The file project.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file that reads local csv file as well as fetching Yelp API data. After combining the fetching data and local csv data, it saves the combined data into a cache file. Moreover, it can construct a binary search tree from the cached file data and save it to a json file.

The file program.py is the program file of this project. You can run it directly to start the program. It will ask the user for the zip code to focus on the nearby restaurants for later interaction. 

To interact with the program, the user has four options: look for top-rated restaurants in the given zip code area, look at the detailed information of a restaurant in the given zip code area, look at a map that shows all restaurants in the given zip code area, look for restaurants that have certain category in the given zip code area
